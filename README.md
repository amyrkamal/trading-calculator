# Simple CLI based Trading Calculater.
Definition: this proram will calcualte at what price should you sell to be able to make profit.

seem simple but buying and selling see usually is percentage. so it is not easy to predict. as the selling fee is a changing value.

# Building and running (very simple)
in your terminal run it using g++ as follow
`` g++ tradingcal.cpp -o tradingcal ``

there is a compiled file too which should work as there is no library

# Future Goal
i am planning to turn it into a advanced live calculator. later with graphical user interface as i have time. and go with trading myself. 
this is only for long positions.
